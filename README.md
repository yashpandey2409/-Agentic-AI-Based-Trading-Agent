# Agentic-AI-Based-Trading-Agent
Developed an AI trading agent using Agentic AI and Deep Q-Learning to autonomously make trading decisions. Achieved consistent positive returns post-training, demonstrating market adaptability and decision-making capability.

This project demonstrates the implementation of an AI trading agent using Agentic AI principles and Deep Q-Learning (DQN). The system is designed to make autonomous trading decisions in a simulated stock market environment.

Key components of the agentic architecture include:

Agent: A DQN-based model that learns to trade by interacting with the environment.

Environment: A simulated stock market environment built using historical price data.

State: Features such as closing prices, moving averages, and daily returns.

Action Space: Buy, Sell, or Hold decisions.

Reward Function: Designed to maximize overall trading profit.

The agent is trained to learn optimal trading strategies by continuously improving through interaction and reward feedback.
